## Next steps for v2

- `claude-flow.yml` configurable pipeline with step order and prompts.
- Backlog integration as alternative task source.
- Optional remote runner and webhook mode.
- Richer web UI with streaming logs and diff previews.
- Concurrent Task Execution: Refactor the orchestrator and state management tools (`status.ts`, `validators.ts`) to robustly support running multiple tasks concurrently within the same repository, moving from a single `current.state.json` to a task-ID-based system.
- Interactive Initialization: Enhance the `claude-project init` command to detect existing script or dependency conflicts in `package.json` and interactively prompt the user for resolution (e.g., overwrite, skip), making it safer to adopt in established repositories.
- Centralized Project Configuration: Introduce a `claude.config.ts` file to centralize hard-coded paths (e.g., for state, logs, tasks) and command names, providing an intermediate step towards the fully dynamic `claude-flow.yml`.
- Add license and version information, then publish to npm publicly
