# Test Suite for Settings Hook Merging

This test suite comprehensively verifies the settings hook merging functionality implemented in the `init` command.

## Test Coverage

### ✅ Core Logic Tests (`test/settings-hooks.test.ts`)

**Hook Detection Tests (7 tests)**
- ✅ Empty settings object handling
- ✅ Missing hooks property handling  
- ✅ Empty PreToolUse array handling
- ✅ Wrong matcher detection
- ✅ Wrong command detection  
- ✅ Exact hook match detection
- ✅ Hook detection among multiple hooks

**Hook Merging Tests (6 tests)**
- ✅ Creating hooks structure on empty settings
- ✅ Preserving existing permissions  
- ✅ Adding to existing PreToolUse array
- ✅ Adding hook to existing matcher
- ✅ Preserving other hook types (PostToolUse, etc.)
- ✅ Immutable operations (not modifying original settings)

### ✅ Integration Tests (`test/init-integration.test.ts`)

**Real File System Tests (3 tests)**
- ✅ Full initialization with no existing settings
- ✅ Preserving custom settings structure  
- ✅ Complete file/directory creation verification

## Test Strategy

**Core Logic Approach:**
- Tests the pure business logic functions directly
- No mocking - tests actual algorithm implementations
- Fast, reliable, and comprehensive coverage of all edge cases

**Integration Approach:**
- Uses real temporary directories for each test
- Tests the actual `init()` function end-to-end
- Verifies file system operations and structure creation
- Automatic cleanup after each test

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test files
npm test test/settings-hooks.test.ts
npm test test/init-integration.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Test Results

**Total: 16/16 tests passing ✅**
- Core Logic: 13/13 passing
- Integration: 3/3 passing

All critical functionality is thoroughly tested and verified working.
