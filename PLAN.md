You've made a very sharp observation, and your critique is spot on.

Let's break down how the implementation of the plan went.

### How the Implementation Went: A "Technically Correct" but Flawed Result

Functionally and structurally, the AI agent did an excellent job. It successfully followed the plan to the letter:

*   **Correct Architecture:** The monorepo structure with `src/backend` and `src/frontend` is in place.
*   **Functional Components:** All the planned Vue components (`TaskCard`, `LogViewer`, `PipelineSteps`, etc.) were created.
*   **Working State Management:** The Pinia store is correctly set up to manage state.
*   **API and Routing:** The backend API routes were created, and the frontend router connects the views.

**In short, the agent built a perfect "skeleton" of the application. The code is structured correctly, and the pieces are in the right places.**

However, your critique reveals the critical missing piece: **UI/UX design and layout.** The agent successfully created the building blocks but assembled them using Vuetify's default, spacious settings, which are optimized for general-purpose applications, not for a dense, information-rich developer dashboard.

You are absolutely right: **we lost the information density and thoughtful layout of the original EJS version.** The current implementation prioritizes showing one thing at a time in large containers, which is not suitable for this tool.

### A New Plan for UI/UX Refinement

Your feedback is the perfect starting point for the next phase. We don't need to undo the refactoring; we need to build on top of it by applying layout, density adjustments, and custom styling.

Here is a new `PLAN.md` that focuses exclusively on fixing the UI and restoring the information-dense layout you liked.

# PLAN.MD: UI/UX Refinement and Information Density

## Title & Goal

**Title:** Refine Dashboard UI for Information Density and Professional Polish

**Goal:** To refactor the existing Vue components and views to match the information density and usability of the original EJS dashboard, with a focus on layout, compactness, and a professional aesthetic.

---

## Description

The Vue 3 application is functionally sound but lacks the specific UI/UX required for a developer-centric dashboard. The current layout uses default Vuetify components, resulting in excessive white space, low information density, and a layout on the Live Activity page that is not fit for purpose.

This plan will address these issues by:
1.  Switching list views from individual cards to dense data tables.
2.  Re-implementing the Live Activity page with a proper sidebar/main content layout.
3.  Styling the log viewer to look and feel like a proper terminal.
4.  Applying global density settings and custom CSS to reduce wasted space and improve the overall visual hierarchy.

---

## Summary Checklist

-   [ ] **1. Refactor History View for Density:** Replace the vertical list of `<TaskCard>` and `<SequenceCard>` components with information-dense Vuetify data tables.
-   [ ] **2. Re-architect the Live Activity View Layout:** Change the single-column layout to a two-column layout with a fixed sidebar for context and a primary, large area for the live log viewer.
-   [ ] **3. Enhance the Log Viewer Component:** Style the log viewer to resemble a terminal and add real-time auto-scrolling functionality.
-   [ ] **4. Apply Global Compact Styling:** Use Vuetify's `density` prop and targeted CSS to make all components (cards, lists, chips) smaller and more compact.

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### 1. Refactor History View for Density

*   **Objective:** To display more tasks and sequences on a single screen without scrolling, mimicking the efficiency of the old table-based layout.
*   **File to Modify:** `src/frontend/src/views/HistoryView.vue`
*   **Existing Components to Modify/Remove:** The use of `TaskCard.vue` and `SequenceCard.vue` on this page will be **removed** in favor of tables.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  In `HistoryView.vue`, remove the `v-for` loops that render the card components.
    2.  Use the **`<v-data-table>`** component from Vuetify for both "Recent Sequences" and "Recent Standalone Tasks".
    3.  **For the Tasks table**, define columns for: Status (using the `<StatusBadge>` component inside the table cell), Task ID, Pipeline, Duration, and Last Update.
    4.  **For the Sequences table**, define columns for: Status, Sequence ID, Folder Path, and Duration.
    5.  Make each row clickable, navigating to the respective detail page.
*   **Acceptance Criteria (for Playwright MCP):**
    *   The `/history` page now displays two tables instead of two columns of large cards.
    *   The tables are compact, showing multiple runs without requiring immediate scrolling.
    *   The "Status" column in the tables correctly renders the colorful `StatusBadge` component.

### 2. Re-architect the Live Activity View Layout

*   **Objective:** To prioritize the log viewer, making it the central focus of the page while keeping contextual information accessible in a sidebar.
*   **File to Modify:** `src/frontend/src/views/LiveActivityView.vue`
*   **Existing Components to Use:** `PipelineSteps.vue`, `LogViewer.vue`
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  Wrap the entire page content in a **`<v-row>`**.
    2.  **Create a Sidebar Column:**
        *   Use a **`<v-col cols="12" md="4">`**. This column will take up the full width on small screens and 1/3 of the width on medium-and-up screens.
        *   Place the `Task/Sequence Info` card and the **`<PipelineSteps>`** component inside this column.
    3.  **Create a Main Content Column:**
        *   Use a **`<v-col cols="12" md="8">`**. This will take up the remaining 2/3 of the width on larger screens.
        *   Place the **`<LogViewer>`** component as the *only* item in this column.
*   **Code Snippet (`LiveActivityView.vue`):**
    ```vue
    <template>
      <v-container fluid>
        <v-row>
          <!-- Sidebar Column -->
          <v-col cols="12" md="4">
            <v-card class="mb-4"> <!-- Task Info Card --> </v-card>
            <PipelineSteps :steps="liveTask.steps" />
          </v-col>

          <!-- Main Log Viewer Column -->
          <v-col cols="12" md="8">
            <LogViewer :is-live="true" />
          </v-col>
        </v-row>
      </v-container>
    </template>
    ```
*   **Acceptance Criteria (for Playwright MCP):**
    *   On a desktop-sized screen, the Live Activity page has a narrow column on the left containing the task details and pipeline steps.
    *   A large column on the right takes up the majority of the screen space and contains the log viewer.

### 3. Enhance the Log Viewer Component

*   **Objective:** To make the log viewer more functional and visually appropriate for displaying raw log data.
*   **File to Modify:** `src/frontend/src/components/LogViewer.vue`
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Terminal-like Styling:** Modify the CSS to make the log viewer look like a terminal. Use a dark background, a monospace font, and remove the card's box-shadow.
    2.  **Auto-Scrolling:** Add logic to automatically scroll the log content to the bottom as new lines are added in live mode. This can be done using a `watch` on the log content and then setting `element.scrollTop = element.scrollHeight`.
    3.  **Colorization:** Implement a function that takes a log line as input and wraps specific keywords (like `[ASSISTANT]`, `[TOOL_USE]`, `[ERROR]`) in `<span>` tags with different colors, similar to the old EJS version's `colorizeLogLine` function.
*   **Acceptance Criteria (for Playwright MCP):**
    *   The log viewer on both the Live and Detail pages has a dark background and uses a monospace font.
    *   On the Live Activity page, as new logs stream in, the view automatically scrolls to show the latest lines.
    *   Keywords like `[ASSISTANT]` are colored blue, and `[TOOL_USE]` is colored yellow.

### 4. Apply Global Compact Styling

*   **Objective:** To reduce the overall "chunkiness" of the UI and increase information density across the entire application.
*   **Files to Modify:** All View and Component `.vue` files.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Use `density` Prop:** Go through all Vuetify components (`v-card`, `v-list`, `v-chip`, `v-btn`, etc.) and add the `density="compact"` prop. This is a built-in Vuetify feature to reduce padding and margins.
    2.  **Reduce Card Padding:** For `v-card` components that still feel too large, use helper classes like `pa-2` (padding all sides) instead of the default.
    3.  **Adjust Typography:** Change large titles from `text-h4` to `text-h5` or `text-h6` where appropriate to save vertical space.
*   **Acceptance Criteria (for Playwright MCP):**
    *   The cards on the detail pages are visibly smaller and have less internal padding.
    *   Buttons and chips throughout the application are smaller.
    *   Overall, the UI feels tighter and more professional, allowing more information to be displayed on the screen at once.
