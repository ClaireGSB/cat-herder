# Claude Project

A command-line tool that orchestrates a structured, step-gated development workflow in your repository using Claude.

`claude-project` transforms your development process into a systematic and automated pipeline. By installing this single tool, you can run tasks through a controlled, multi-step process that includes planning, test generation, implementation, documentation updates, and code review, all with automated checkpoints and git commits.

## Installation

Install the CLI globally using npm. This makes the `claude-project` command available anywhere on your system.

```bash
npm install -g @your-scope/claude-project
```

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to integrate the Claude workflow into your existing TypeScript project.

1.  **Navigate to your project's root directory:**

```bash
cd your-typescript-project
```

2.  **Initialize the project:**
This command sets up everything you need: it creates a `claude.config.js` file, scaffolds default command prompts in a `.claude` directory, adds a sample task, and updates your `package.json` with necessary scripts and dependencies.
```bash
claude-project init
```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
The `init` command adds several development dependencies (like `vitest` and `prettier`) to your `package.json`. Run `npm install` to add them to your project.
```bash
npm install
```

4.  **Run the automated workflow:**
Use the npm script to execute the sample task.
```bash
npm run claude:run claude-Tasks/task-001-sample.md
```

The orchestrator will now take over, running each step of the pipeline and committing its progress along the way.

## How to Test Locally (for Developers)

When developing the `claude-project` tool itself, you need a way to test your local changes without publishing to npm. This is done using `npm link`.

### Part 1: Initial One-Time Setup

First, set up your `claude-project` tool and create a dedicated test environment.

1.  **Globally Link Your Tool:** In the root directory of your `claude-project` source code, run these commands. This builds your tool and creates a global symlink to it that your system can use.
```bash
# In your claude-project repository root
npm run build
npm link
```

2.  **Create a Test Environment:** Set up a separate, clean project to test in.
```bash
# From a parent directory (e.g., cd ..)
rm -rf my-test-app
mkdir my-test-app
cd my-test-app
npm init -y
git init
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial commit"
```

3.  **Initialize and Install in the Test App:** Now, from inside `my-test-app`, run the setup process. The order is important.
```bash
# Inside the my-test-app directory

# Run your tool's init command
claude-project init

# Link the dependency to your local source
npm link @your-scope/claude-project

# Install other dependencies like vitest and prettier
npm install
```
Your test environment is now ready.

### Part 2: The Re-Testing Workflow (Every Time You Change Code)

This is the loop you will follow every time you make changes to `claude-project` and want to test them.

1.  **Rebuild Your Tool:** After saving changes in your `claude-project` source code, you must rebuild it.
```bash
# In your claude-project repository root
npm run build
```

2.  **Run the "Safe Clean" Command:** Navigate to your test app directory and run this command. It removes all artifacts from the last run **without deleting your custom commands or pipeline configuration**.
```bash
# In your my-test-app directory
rm -f PLAN.md && rm -rf .claude/state/ .claude/logs/ && git clean -fd src/ test/
```


3.  **Run the Task:** You can now immediately run a fresh test. There is no need to re-initialize or reinstall dependencies.
```bash
# In your my-test-app directory
npm run claude:run claude-Tasks/task-001-sample.md
```

4. **Removing old test repo and creating fresh one** 

If you want to start over with a fresh test environment, you can delete the `my-test-app` directory and repeat the initial setup steps.

```bash
# --- 1. Tear Down the Old Environment ---
echo "Removing old test environment..."
rm -rf my-test-app

# --- 2. Create the New Project Shell ---
echo "Creating a fresh test environment..."
mkdir my-test-app
cd my-test-app
npm init -y > /dev/null
git init > /dev/null
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial commit" > /dev/null

# --- 3. Link and Initialize Your Tool ---
echo "Linking to local claude-project and initializing..."
npm link @your-scope/claude-project
claude-project init
npm install

echo "\nâœ… Fresh test environment is ready!"
```

## How It Works

### The Configurable Pipeline (`claude.config.js`)

This tool is driven by a `pipeline` array in your `claude.config.js` file. You have full control to reorder, remove, or even add new steps to this pipeline. Each step is an object with four key properties:

-   `name`: A unique identifier for the step.
-   `command`: The name of the corresponding `.md` file in `.claude/commands/`.
-   `context`: An array of data "providers" to build the prompt for the AI.
-   `check`: A validation object to confirm the step was successful.

```javascript
// claude.config.js
module.exports = {
  taskFolder: "claude-Tasks",
  statePath: ".claude/state",
  logsPath: ".claude/logs",
  structureIgnore: [
    "node_modules/**",
    ".git/**",
    "dist/**",
    ".claude/**",
    "*.lock",
  ],

  /**
   * If true (default), the tool automatically creates a dedicated Git branch
   * for each task. Set to false to run the tool on your current branch.
   */
  manageGitBranch: true,

  /**
   * Defines the sequence of steps in the development workflow.
   * The orchestrator will execute these steps in order.
   */
  pipeline: [
    {
      name: "plan",
      command: "plan-task",
      context: ["projectStructure", "taskDefinition"],
      check: { type: "fileExists", path: "PLAN.md" },
      fileAccess: {
        allowWrite: ["PLAN.md"]
      }
    },
    {
      name: "write_tests",
      command: "write-tests",
      context: ["planContent", "taskDefinition"],
      check: { type: "shell", command: "npm test", expect: "fail" },
      fileAccess: {
        allowWrite: ["test/**/*", "tests/**/*"]
      }
    },
    {
      name: "implement",
      command: "implement",
      context: ["planContent"],
      check: { type: "shell", command: "npm test", expect: "pass" },
      fileAccess: {
        allowWrite: ["src/**/*"]
      }
    },
    {
      name: "docs",
      command: "docs-update",
      context: ["planContent", "projectStructure"],
      check: { type: "none" },
      fileAccess: {
        allowWrite: ["README.md", "docs/**/*", "*.md"]
      }
    },
    {
      name: "review",
      command: "self-review",
      context: [],
      check: { type: "none" },
      // No fileAccess restriction for review step - allows any necessary fixes
    },
  ],
};
```

**Available Context Providers:**
- `projectStructure`: A list of all files in your project
- `taskDefinition`: The content of the task markdown file
- `planContent`: The content of the generated PLAN.md file

**Check Types:**
```javascript
// Check that a file was created
check: { type: "fileExists", path: "PLAN.md" }

// Check that a command runs and exits successfully
check: { type: "shell", command: "npm test", expect: "pass" }

// Check that a command runs and fails (e.g., for initial tests)
check: { type: "shell", command: "npm test", expect: "fail" }

// No automated validation
check: { type: "none" }
```

### Customizable Guardrails (`fileAccess`)

The `fileAccess` property allows you to control which files Claude can modify during each step of your pipeline. This provides fine-grained control over the development workflow and prevents accidental modifications to unintended files.

**Basic Usage:**
Add the `fileAccess` property to any pipeline step:

```javascript
{
  name: "implement",
  command: "implement",
  context: ["planContent"],
  check: { type: "shell", command: "npm test", expect: "pass" },
  fileAccess: {
    allowWrite: ["src/**/*", "lib/**/*"]
  }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Glob Pattern Matching**: Uses standard glob patterns for flexible file matching (e.g., `src/**/*`, `*.md`, `test/**/*.spec.ts`)
- **Step-Specific Control**: Each pipeline step can have different file access rules
- **Optional Enforcement**: Omitting the `fileAccess` property allows unrestricted file access for that step
- **Clear Error Messages**: When a file write is blocked, you'll receive a clear message indicating which patterns are allowed

**Common Examples:**
```javascript
// Allow only test file modifications
fileAccess: {
  allowWrite: ["test/**/*", "tests/**/*", "**/*.test.ts", "**/*.spec.ts"]
}

// Allow source code changes
fileAccess: {
  allowWrite: ["src/**/*", "lib/**/*"]
}

// Allow documentation updates
fileAccess: {
  allowWrite: ["README.md", "docs/**/*", "*.md"]
}

// No restrictions (same as omitting fileAccess entirely)
// fileAccess: { allowWrite: ["**/*"] }
```

**Error Handling:**
When Claude attempts to modify a file that doesn't match the allowed patterns, the operation is blocked with a message like:
```
Blocked: The current step 'implement' only allows file modifications matching ["src/**/*"]. Action on 'README.md' denied.
```

This feature ensures that each step of your pipeline only modifies the files it should, providing confidence in your automated workflow.

### Debugging and Logs

The orchestrator provides comprehensive logging to help you understand both what happened and why. For each pipeline step, two log files are created in the `.claude/logs/` directory:

- **`XX-step-name.log`**: Contains the final, clean output from the AI tool. This is the polished result you would normally see.
- **`XX-step-name.reasoning.log`**: Contains the AI's detailed reasoning process. This shows the step-by-step thinking that led to the final output.

**When to use each log:**
- Use the standard `.log` file to see what the AI produced and any errors that occurred.
- Use the `.reasoning.log` file to understand *why* the AI made specific decisions, especially when debugging unexpected outputs or behaviors.

The reasoning logs are particularly valuable when:
- A step produces unexpected results
- You want to understand the AI's decision-making process
- You're fine-tuning your prompts or pipeline configuration
- You need to troubleshoot complex implementation choices

### Isolated and Resumable Git Branches

By default (`manageGitBranch: true`), the orchestrator automatically manages Git branches for you. When you run a task:

1.  It first checks that your repository has no uncommitted changes.
2.  It switches to your local `main` branch. If you have a remote repository named `origin`, it attempts to pull the latest changes to ensure you're up to date. (If you have a local-only repository, it safely skips this step).
3.  It then creates a unique, dedicated branch for the task (e.g., `claude/my-new-feature`).
4.  All commits generated by the AI during the pipeline are made to this task branch.

This keeps your `main` branch clean and isolates all automated work, whether you are working locally or with a remote team.

**Alternative Mode:** If you set `manageGitBranch: false` in your config, the tool will skip all branch management and run directly on your current branch. This is useful for advanced workflows where you want full control over Git operations, but you'll see a warning that the tool is operating on your current branch.

### Permissions and Security (`.claude/settings.json`)

For the orchestrator to run non-interactively, it needs permission to execute `Bash` commands like `npm test` and `git commit`. The `claude-project init` command scaffolds a `.claude/settings.json` file with a safe set of default permissions to enable this.

This file pre-approves `Bash` commands that are essential for the default workflow (scoped to `npm`, `git`, and `vitest`) while denying network access. **Important:** If you have an existing `.claude/settings.json` file, the `init` command **will not overwrite it**, preserving your custom configuration.

Managing these permissions is simple, even when you customize your pipeline. The **`claude-project validate`** command acts as a safety net and a helper. When you add a new step or command that requires a `Bash` permission not listed in your `settings.json`, the validator will detect it and offer to fix it for you.

For example, if you add a `lint` step that needs to run `npm run lint:fix`, the validator will show you:

> ```
> âœ– Pipeline configuration is invalid:
> 
>   - Step 4 ('lint'): Requires missing permission "Bash(npm run lint:fix)"
> 
> This command can automatically add the missing permissions for you.
> Would you like to add these permissions to .claude/settings.json? (y/N)
> ```

If you press `y` and hit Enter, the tool will safely and automatically add the required permission to your `settings.json` file. This turns the validator into a powerful assistant, ensuring your security settings always stay in sync with your workflow.
