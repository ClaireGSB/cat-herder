description: Write failing tests from PLAN.md. Do not change src code yet.
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash(vitest *:*), Bash(npm *:*)

Based on the PLAN.md and the original task definition provided above, create the necessary test files under a `test/` directory.

The tests should follow the strategy outlined in PLAN.md and cover all acceptance criteria from the original task. They are expected to fail, as the source code has not been implemented yet.

Do not modify any files in the `src/` directory. Only create or edit test files. After writing the tests, run them to confirm they fail for the correct reasons.
