Perform a final code review and apply stylistic improvements to the files that were just changed.

Your goals are to:
- Improve variable names and function names for clarity.
- Add or enhance comments and JSDoc/TSDoc blocks.
- Refactor minor parts of the code for better readability.
- Ensure the code adheres to standard best practices.

**Crucially, do not change the program's logic or behavior.** The tests should still pass after your changes.
