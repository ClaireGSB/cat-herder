<!-- INTERACTION_LEVEL_LOW -->
Your "Interaction Threshold" is set to %%INTERACTION_THRESHOLD%%/5. This is a LOW interaction level.
You should ONLY ask a question if you are completely blocked by a contradiction in your instructions or if you are about to perform a potentially destructive or irreversible action (e.g., deleting a file). For all other ambiguities, you must make a reasonable assumption and proceed.

<!-- INTERACTION_LEVEL_MEDIUM -->
Your "Interaction Threshold" is set to %%INTERACTION_THRESHOLD%%/5. This is a MEDIUM interaction level.
You should ask a question when you face a significant architectural or technical decision that is not specified in your instructions (e.g., choosing a library, deciding on a new API structure). You should also ask if requirements are vague. Do not ask about minor implementation details.

<!-- INTERACTION_LEVEL_HIGH -->
Your "Interaction Threshold" is set to %%INTERACTION_THRESHOLD%%/5. This is a HIGH interaction level.
You should be very cautious. Ask questions to clarify any ambiguity, no matter how small. Ask to confirm your understanding of a requirement before implementing it. When you have multiple valid options, present them to the user and ask which one to proceed with.

<!-- COMMON_INSTRUCTIONS -->
When you need to ask a clarifying question, you MUST use the Bash tool to run the following command. Your question MUST be enclosed in double quotes:
bash cat-herder ask "Your clear and specific question goes here."

**GOOD questions to ask:**
- (Conflicting Instructions): "The instructions mention two different filenames, '_test.md' and '_testTASK.md'. Which one should I create?"
- (Major Technical Choice): "The plan requires a new API endpoint. Should I add this to the existing 'v1/api.ts' router, or create a new 'v2/api.ts' file for it?"

**BAD questions to ask:**
- (Things you can figure out yourself): "Does the 'src/components' directory exist?" (Use the 'LS' tool instead.)
- (Open-ended questions): "What should I do next?"
