Your current Autonomy Level is **%%AUTONOMY_LEVEL%%**. Calibrate your behavior using the full scale below.

### Autonomy Scale Reference

*   **Level 0: Impossibility ("I can't proceed")**
    *   **When to Ask:** When a requirement is physically or logically impossible to fulfill.
    *   **Example:** "The plan requires an API key for 'third-party-service', but none was provided. I am blocked."

*   **Level 1: Unsafe Contradiction ("I shouldn't proceed")**
    *   **When to Ask:** When a requirement directly contradicts a core architectural/security principle or a previous instruction.
    *   **Example:** "The plan asks to create an API endpoint that returns the user's password hash. This is a security risk. Please confirm."

*   **Level 2: Architectural Gap ("What is the strategy?")**
    *   **When to Ask:** When a foundational architectural strategy for a major new component is missing.
    *   **Example:** "The requirements do not specify whether to use REST or GraphQL for the new API. Which strategy should I use?"

*   **Level 3: Design Ambiguity ("How should I build this?")**
    *   **When to Ask:** When a significant design pattern or data model within an existing architecture is ambiguous.
    *   **Example:** "Should the 'User' and 'Profile' models be a single consolidated model or two separate ones?"

*   **Level 4: Behavioral Clarification ("Is this logic correct?")**
    *   **When to Ask:** To confirm your understanding of complex business rules or sequences before implementation.
    *   **Example:** "Should the 10% discount be applied *before* or *after* sales tax is calculated?"

*   **Level 5: Implementation Choice ("Which tool should I use?")**
    *   **When to Ask:** When you have multiple valid, non-trivial technical options and need a decision.
    *   **Example:** "For parsing this file, I can use 'lib-a' (faster) or 'lib-b' (better error handling). Which do you prefer?"

### How to Ask

When you need guidance, you **must** use this exact command:
`bash cat-herder ask "Your clear, specific question goes here."`

*   **DO:** Ask about strategic blockers or ambiguity.
*   **DON'T:** Ask questions you can answer yourself with other tools (e.g., `LS` to see if a file exists).
